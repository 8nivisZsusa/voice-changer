## How to Use Gullfoss
 
Gullfoss is very simple to use. You just need to insert it as an effect on the track or bus that you want to process, and adjust the four main parameters: Recover, Tame, Bias, and Brighten. These parameters control how Gullfoss analyzes and modifies the frequency spectrum of the audio.
 
- Recover: This parameter boosts the frequencies that are masked or suppressed by other sounds in the mix. It helps to bring out the details and clarity of the audio.
- Tame: This parameter reduces the frequencies that are too loud or dominant in the mix. It helps to balance the audio and avoid harshness or muddiness.
- Bias: This parameter shifts the balance between the low and high frequencies of the audio. It helps to adjust the tonal character and warmth of the audio.
- Brighten: This parameter adds a gentle high-frequency boost to the audio. It helps to enhance the sparkle and airiness of the audio.

You can also adjust the Boost parameter, which controls the overall level of the audio after processing, and the Bypass button, which allows you to compare the processed and unprocessed audio. You can also enable or disable the Automatic Gain Compensation (AGC) feature, which maintains a consistent output level regardless of the input level.
 
Gullfoss has a graphical user interface that shows you a real-time visualization of the frequency spectrum of the audio and how it is affected by Gullfoss. You can also see a numerical readout of the amount of Recover and Tame applied at each frequency band. This helps you to understand what Gullfoss is doing and fine-tune your settings if needed.
